# Boids-ThreeJS 

I built the project using Three.js, a JavaScript library, and boids based on V. Hunter Adams' implementation that I found on https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Animal_Movement/Boids-algorithm.html. It was my first time using Three.js, and I was impressed by how easy and intuitive it was to use. I'm definitely planning to use it for future projects.

In case you're not familiar, boids are a type of artificial life program that simulate the behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish. They're made up of simple rules, like alignment with nearby boids, avoidance of collisions, and attraction to the center of mass of nearby boids, that create the illusion of coordinated group movement.
